## Projects I am currently working on for fun and learning[^1]

### Cycles in the Biosphere

Designed to be an educational resource that covers primary (Key Stage 1) through to postgraduate level. This ambitious aim seeks to cover all the major biogeological cycles and the flow of energy using a range of specific examples, some drawn from current research, with the best that modern web technology can provide. I am hoping to build this site using the Microsoft stack, i.e. .Net Core and Blazor.Cycles is already in progress and is set up as a private GitHub repository. At this stage I am hoping there will be a commercial future for Cycles so involvement in this project will be restricted. This may change in the future.

### Book of useful things

Based on Stuff Worth Knowing a handbook written by Paul E Johnson of the University of Kansas. This is an eclectic book sized document that, in my view, I wish had been available to me when I was an undergraduate. I have long wished to write an updated Open-Source version.

### Hyrax

A lightweight, cloud based human resources database that uses AI to make predictions about employee performance and other key HR metrics. The application will be built using the Microsoft stack.

### Sciatis
Is my other [website](http://sciatis.co.uk) which will host more technical content. The site is currently down for a redesign.

[^1]:Book of Useful Things and Hyrax are Open Source and will be set up as public GitHub repositories.
