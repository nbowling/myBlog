I have enjoyed hill walking and mountaineering including several alpine seasons.

My favourite activity though, was potholing having bottomed some of the most serious potholes in the UK.

Sadly, ill health and arthritis have largely put paid to that now, so I am developing my skills in photography, art and IT. I also enjoy the occasional flight using [DCS World](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/), a powerful PC based flight simulator. But last but far from least my beautiful wife Hilly who has been my rock and inspiration for 30+ years now.
