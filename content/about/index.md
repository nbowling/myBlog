title: "About Me"

Hello there...

I'm Nick Bowling a retired specialist in data analysis in the Human Resources domain. I am currently retired but working on a number of projects of significant interest to me. This website gives some information about me and describes these projects and also provides ways for you to get involved should you feel inclined.

I am an Honours Graduate in Biology but apart from a year working as a virologist for the UK Government I have for the first half of my career worked with young adults who present with various behavioural and mental health issues. Along the way I have collected post graduate qualifications in Teaching and Social Work. For the last third of my working life I found myself, like so many of my generation, drifting into Information Technology and became the payroll systems manager for a large UK Local Authority. Part of this role was to provide Human Resources information to senior managers and elected members of the council.

### For fun

Image insert = tenacity + alps + potholing + etc (possibly a carousel)
I have enjoyed hill walking and mountaineering having survived several alpine seasons. My favourite activity though was potholing having bottomed some of the most serious potholes in the UK. Sadly, ill health and arthritis have largely put paid to that now, so I am developing my skills in photography and IT. I also enjoy the occasional flight using DCS World, a powerful PC based flight simulator.

### Projects I am currently working on for fun and learning.

#### Cycles in the Biosphere

Designed to be an educational resource that covers primary (Key Stage 1) through to postgraduate level. This ambitious aim seeks to cover all the major biogeological cycles and the flow of energy using a range of specific examples, some drawn from current research, with the best that modern web technology can provide. Cycles is already in progress and is set up as a private GitHub repository. At this stage I am hoping there will be a commercial future for Cycles so involvement in this project will be restricted. This may change in the future.

#### Book of useful things

Based on Stuff Worth Knowing a handbook written by Paul E Johnson of the University of Kansas. This is an eclectic book sized document that in my view, I wished had been available to me when I was an undergraduate. I have long wished to write an updated Open-Source version.

#### Hyrax

A lightweight, cloud based human resources database that uses AI to make predictions about employee performance and other key HR metrics. The application will be built using the Microsoft stack.

Book of Useful Things and Hyrax are Open Source and will be set up as public GitHub repositories.

### I'm available forâ€¦

I may be interested in paid or voluntary work if it is for organisations that are involved in education for disadvantaged groups or organisations that work in the natural environment.
