title: "About Me"
---

Hello there...

I'm Nick Bowling, a retired specialist in Human Resources data analysis. Now, I'm working on a number of projects of personal interest to me. This website gives some information about me, introduces these projects and provides ways for you to get involved should you feel inclined.

I'm an Honours Graduate in Biology but apart from a year working as a virologist for the UK Government the first half of my career was spent working with young adults who presented with behavioural and mental health issues. Along the way I collected postgraduate qualifications in Teaching and Social Work. For the last third of my working life I found myself, like so many of my generation, drifting into Information Technology. I became the payroll systems manager for a large UK Local Authority. Part of this role was to provide Human Resources information to senior managers and elected members of the council. I also worked on several large projects including a major SAP implementation. I also led a project implementing a large Government IT project in Gloucestershire. Although highly successful the project was eventually scrapped by the incoming Conservative Government in 2010 (more about this short sighted decision later in my blog).

## For fun

I have enjoyed hill walking and mountaineering surviving several alpine seasons. My favourite activity though, was potholing having bottomed some of the most serious potholes in the UK. Sadly, ill health and arthritis have largely put paid to that now, so I am developing my skills in photography, art and IT. I also enjoy the occasional flight using [DCS World](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/), a powerful PC based flight simulator.

## Projects I am currently working on for fun and learning

### Cycles in the Biosphere

Designed to be an educational resource that covers primary (Key Stage 1) through to postgraduate level. This ambitious aim seeks to cover all the major biogeological cycles and the flow of energy using a range of specific examples, some drawn from current research, with the best that modern web technology can provide. Cycles is already in progress and is set up as a private GitHub repository. At this stage I am hoping there will be a commercial future for Cycles so involvement in this project will be restricted. This may change in the future.

### Book of useful things

Based on Stuff Worth Knowing a handbook written by Paul E Johnson of the University of Kansas. This is an eclectic book sized document that, in my view, I wish had been available to me when I was an undergraduate. I have long wished to write an updated Open-Source version.

### Hyrax

A lightweight, cloud based human resources database that uses AI to make predictions about employee performance and other key HR metrics. The application will be built using the Microsoft stack.

<em>Book of Useful Things and Hyrax are Open Source and will be set up as public GitHub repositories.</em>

## I'm available forâ€¦

I may be interested in paid or voluntary work for organisations that are involved in education for disadvantaged groups or organisations that work in the natural environment.
