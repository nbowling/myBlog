    <p>Hello there&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Nick Bowling, a retired specialist in Human Resources data analysis. Now, I&rsquo;m working on a number of projects of personal interest to me. This website gives some information about me, introduces these projects and provides ways for you to get involved should you feel inclined.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an Honours Graduate in Biology but apart from a year working as a virologist for the UK Government the first half of my career was spent working with young adults who presented with behavioural and mental health issues. Along the way I collected postgraduate qualifications in Teaching and Social Work. For the last third of my working life I found myself, like so many of my generation, drifting into Information Technology. I became the payroll systems manager for a large UK Local Authority. Part of this role was to provide Human Resources information to senior managers and elected members of the council.</p>
<p>Laterly I worked on several large projects including a major SAP implementation and leading a project implementing a large Government IT project in Gloucestershire.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we could have achieved what we have so far without the enormous commitment you have shown during this period. I am also grateful to your team for their valuable contributions.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>We congratulate the council in its forward-thinking use of IT and data analysis in supporting your HR teams in achieving a significant reduction in sickness absence.

<h2 id="for-fun">For fun</h2>
<p>I have enjoyed hill walking and mountaineering including several alpine seasons. My favourite activity though, was potholing having bottomed some of the most serious potholes in the UK. Sadly, ill health and arthritis have largely put paid to that now, so I am developing my skills in photography, art and IT. I also enjoy the occasional flight using <a href="https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/">DCS World</a>, a powerful PC based flight simulator.</p>
<h2 id="im-available-for">I&rsquo;m available forâ€¦</h2>
<p>I may be interested in paid or voluntary work for organisations that are involved in education for disadvantaged groups or organisations that work in the natural environment.</p>
